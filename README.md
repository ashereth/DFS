# DFS

## Files

## List.c
An implimentation of a doubly linked list data structure for use within the the graph data structure.

## List.h
Header file for List.c.

## Graph.c
An implimentation of a Graph data structure along with the BFS() algorithm that can be used to solve \
SSSP.

## Graph.h 
Header file for Graph.c

## GraphTest.c
Test client for GraphTest. Tests all graph ADT functions to make sure it all works properly.

## FindComponents.c
Contains the main program and makes use of the Graph ADT in order to take in an input file, create\ a graph from it and print out that graph along with the strongly connected components found from DFS. Takes an input file and output file as command line arguments.
